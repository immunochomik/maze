  <h2>Few words about Maze Image</h2>

</div>

<div class="container" style="font-size: larger">

  <p>
    It seems to me that the maze generation is a solved problem, therefore chances are small that I will be able to come
    up with anything original. Well maybe that is not the point of the challenge. Maybe it is about making it interesting or funny
    and about showing code skills. If so then it seemed sensible to try any wired idea, for example I could investigate if a
    maze can be generated based on an image.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I have tried two algorithms, recursive backtracker and recursive divider, and in both cases <b>it did not work</b>.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Recursive backtracker</b> works better as the maze can be solved, but the image is not really visible and walls are broken.
  </p>
  <p  style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Recursive divider</b> does not work at all as the resulting maze can not be solved.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I have used rather naive approach, by just getting edges out of the picture and using the edge's matrix as the maze's base. Certainly that
    could be improved. For instance, if the generator is a cell carver then I should ensure that image edges are only walls.
    Furthermore it seems that the idea would work best if the maze is not true angle based, like in case of
    <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/maze/crack.gif">the crack maze</a><br>
    I have not tried any of the above for the lack of time.

    I hope you will have some fun with the Maze Image.
